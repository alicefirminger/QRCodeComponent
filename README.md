# Mobile QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Task

I used HTML and CSS to recreate the front end design of this mobile QR code UI. Below you can see the reference image on the left and my version on the right.
This took me around 30 minutes in total from creating the repo to writing the HTML and finishing the UI layout and styling.
